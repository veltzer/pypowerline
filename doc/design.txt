we will use jsonpicklen to serialze the configuration of pypowerline
which is just a list of Segments.

pypowerline will load the config file, create a list of segments and will call them to print themselves.
Thats it.

In addition there will be global config options, which will take effect if something is not written
in the config file.
Each segment will have its own config.
	ConfigSegmentCwd
	ConfigSegmentGit
	ConfigSegmentPython
and so on.
