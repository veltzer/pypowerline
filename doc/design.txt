how to store the segments configuration:
========================================
I wanted to store them as json serialized format but then understood that
I will need a framework for serialization to/from objects like "jsonpickle".
When trying it out I found issues with the fact that it does not call a constructor
on the objects.
Another issue is that if the end user has to write this json file he will get no help
from any smart editor.

My solution
===========
have the config file be a python file which is executed by pypowerline with the python "exec"
function.

pypowerline will load the config file, create a list of segments and will call them to print themselves.
Thats it.

In addition there will be global config options, which will take effect if something is not written
in the config file.
Each segment will have its own config.
	ConfigSegmentCwd
	ConfigSegmentGit
	ConfigSegmentPython
and so on.
